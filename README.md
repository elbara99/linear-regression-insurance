## Introduction
This project applies a linear regression model to predict medical insurance charges based on various features such as age, BMI, number of children, and more. The project uses a publicly available insurance dataset to train and evaluate the model.
## Features
- **Data Exploration (EDA):** Analyzes the dataset to understand relationships between features.
- **Data Transformation:** Converts categorical variables into numerical values using LabelEncoder.
- **Model Training:** Uses Linear Regression to build a predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance with metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².
- **Visualization:** Includes plots for distribution, correlation, and residual analysis.
